        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I’m a semi-pro rugby player who travels to compete, which has taught me discipline, resilience, and how to thrive in fast-paced, high-pressure environments. Alongside sport, I’ve had a love for design from a young age, sparked by watching HGTV home shows and being fascinated by how creativity can transform spaces and ideas.</p>

        <p>Outside of rugby and design, I value quality time with family and friends, whether that’s shopping together, going out for dinner, or taking spontaneous road trips. At the same time, I enjoy my alone time whether it's unwinding by binge watching Netflix or getting lost in creating art. That balance between being social and reflective helps keep me grounded, inspired, and motivated.
